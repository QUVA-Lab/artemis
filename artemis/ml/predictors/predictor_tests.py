    Assert that your predictor is not a total embarrassment.  (Note that it still may pass this test and be a terrible
    predictor, this at least makes clear that it's not completely broken.)

    :param predictor_constructor: A constructor that returns an IPredictor object given (n_dims_in, n_dims_out) as
        arguments.
    :param initial_score_under: Asser that the initial score on the 4-cluster dataset (where chance is 25%) is worse than
        this (mainly just makes sure you're not cheating somehow)
    :param final_score_over: Assert that the final score is over this - Solving this dataset isn't rocket science.  It
        is not hard to get a final score of 100.
    :param n_epochs: Now many epochs should you run?

        correct label.  Otherwise, it expects a one-hot encoding vector - with the unit corresponding to the label being
        True.

        over training.
