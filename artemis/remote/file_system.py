    This method performs a system call to 'sshfs' in order to mount a remote directory locally. This can be useful if your experiment directory lies
    on you local machine, while your experiment runs on a cluster somewhere. You then do not need to manually synchronize experiment directories across
    machines. Make sure all keys are configured for the mounting operation to succeed without requiring password entry (confer or google ssh-copy-id for instructions).
    Also be aware that this might result in slower reading/writing speed compared to writing to a local directory.
    Tests in our dutch computing cluster show that writing speeds are comparable when the experiment directory is located in the home directory. Since
    the GPU node mounts the home directory within the cluster's network anyways, the writing speeds are identical to when mounting the experiment directory
    on my local desktop machine (which is in the same university WAN). In order for the experiment directory to be available to artemis, make sure you configure your experiment directory to be
    identical to 'local_dir'. todo(matthias): A method to directly mount the experiment directory will be implemented shortly.

    The method registers unmounting of the local directory upon exit of the process (using atexit)

    This method has been tested on Linux only. Mac supports sshfs for example through Homebrew.

    Parameters of this method will be used to compose the sshfs call as:
    sshfs [options] username@ip:remote_dir local_dir
    :param user:
    :param ip:
    :param local_dir: Local directory. Is created if it does not exist. After unmounting, this folder will still be there, but empty.
    :param remote_dir:
    :param options: A list of strings. Each option will be appended as '-o option' to the sshfs call. Call sshfs -h for a list of options.
    When not specified, options ["cache=yes","kernel_cache","compression=no", "large_read", "Ciphers=arcfour"] will be used in an attempt to maximize
    speed at the cost of very weak encryption with arcfour. (Following http://www.admin-magazine.com/HPC/Articles/Sharing-Data-with-SSHFS)
